## About Me

Hello! My name is Nicole Lawrence. I am an aspiring data analyst with a passion for solving real-world problems using data. I recently completed a Data Analytics Bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience in analyzing large datasets, building data visualizations, and communicating actionable insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

My goal is to leverage my analytical skills and data-driven insights to help organizations make better, informed decisions that drive business success.
